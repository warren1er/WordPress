Content Visibility for Divi Builder.

== Description ==

Content Visibility for Divi Builder allows Sections and Modules to be displayed/hidden based on the outcome of a PHP boolean expression.

This plugin is for both the standalone Divi theme (or child themes thereof) or the Divi Builder plugin, versions 2.6 or higher!

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/content-visibility-for-divi-builder` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
1. You're Done! You will notice that Section and Module settings dialogs will now have "Content Visibility" as a configurable setting.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will this work for any module, even custom ones? =

Yes! It detects and modifies Modules and Sections by class inheritance. As long as Elegant Themes continues to have a single root class for everything, this plugin should detect all of them, including third party ones!

= What if I deactivate this plugin? Will all of my content reappear automatically? =

Yes. If you decide to deactivate or uninstall this plugin, the "Content Visibility" configuration option will disappear from the Divi Builder, and will not have any effect on the frontend output.

Of course, the "Content Visibility" settings that were defined for a particular Section or Module will continue to persist in the database, until that post/page is updated. 
This can be a good thing, however, as you may want to reinstall/reactivate in the future and not have to re-enter all of your "Content Visibility" expressions!

= How do I use it!? =

Once the plugin is installed and activated, a "Content Visibility" option will appear under the General Settings / Content tab of each Section or Module's settings.

You may enter any PHP boolean expression you would like, (e.g. is_user_logged_in()), and the Section or Module will only display if the expression evaluates to true.

== Screenshots ==

1. The Content Visibility option in the classic Divi Builder backend interface.

2. The Content Visibility option in the Divi 3.x Visual Builder interface.
